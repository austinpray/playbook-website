    <h1>SaaS Playbooks</h1>
    <p class="lead">Create and implement repeatable processes that will allow your team to hit their metrics and goals.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Your team is working hard but they are wasting time reinventing the wheel, working on ineffective strategies, or too busy to document their process to others can follow along.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Playbooks allow you to create a repository of processes and include in in different playbooks to execute multiple strategies across multiple business functions.</p>
    <h3>Understanding The Hierarchy Of Playbook Terminology</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Playbook - top level - one per team</li>
      <li>Game Plans - second level - multiple game plans per playbook - shareable</li>
      <li>Plays - third level - multiple plays wihtin a game plan - shareable</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each team would have a single playbook they are responsible for keeping up to date and accurate. From there they will create game plans. A team can have multiple game plans wihtin their playbook. Each game plan will be comprised of plays that can be shared acrossed each game plan and other team's playbooks.</p>

    <h3>Example Of Playbooks In Action</h3>

    <h3>What To Watch Out For</h3>
    <p>Teams should not duplicate plays to include them in their game plan. A single play must exist for the topic and be included in other game plans.</p>
